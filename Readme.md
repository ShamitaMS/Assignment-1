# Login Page Using Next.js and AI

## Problem Statement

Build a secure and user-friendly login page using AI and Next.js.

## Approach
I have used LLMs to generate the code and tweaked it according to my needs.
The login page features a clean and interactive design with the following elements:

- **Username & Password Fields**: Basic fields for the user to enter their credentials.
- **Hover Effect on Welcome Text**: When the user hovers over the welcome text, the 4gd.ai logo is displayed.
- **Password Strength Meter**: This feature indicates whether the entered password is strong or weak based on its complexity, helping users create secure passwords.
- **Remember Me Option**: A checkbox to allow users to opt in for saving their credentials for future logins.
- **Forgot Password & Create Account**: Options for users who need to reset their password or create a new account.
- **Sign In Button**: Upon clicking this button, users are redirected to a captcha verification page, enhancing the security of the login process.
- **Social Media Login Options**: The page provides login alternatives via Github, Gmail, and Twitter, for easier access.

## Further Enhancements

To improve the user experience and security, the following features can be added:

- **QR Code for Easy Login**: A QR code can be generated for users to scan and quickly log in using their mobile devices.

Attached below are the screenshots of the login page:
